# CodeQuiz

A 15 question quiz that tests your knowledge in Javascript specifically.
You have 75 seconds to complete, you get 1 point per correct answer
upon completion, you will be directed to a high score page where you can enter your initials if you did well.
You can view other high scores to compare how well you did.

  This was created as part of my coding bootcamp assignment, where we had to create a multiple choice quiz.
Definitely a challenge, but like Frankensteins monster, i was able to piece it together.  Bootstrap elements definetly
helped with the layout, i just edited it to make it cool.

I managed to get it to play sound on correct and incorrect answers, which was a new learning experience for me.
